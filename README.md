# Zestras-Game-of-Life
Welcome to my version of the Game-of-Life Simulation, first designed by Mathematician John Conway.

### How to use it

You first start with a screen.

You can click on the squares in the grid using the mouse, to change their status (white or black).

Pressing the button on the top-right...

will manually simulate the next stage of that generation.

You can click on it again and again to reveal the next generation.

You can change the squares' status at any time you want.

For more information on how simulation this works, you can read this selection below.

You can even make sure my code works by testing the official example in the doccument using my program.

I hope you will enjoy using this experimental applet.

Thank you.
